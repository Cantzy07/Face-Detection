# Real-Time Facial Detection

## Utilizes Open-CV and manually taken images from a webcam as data to recognize if a face is in the screen. Uses albumentations library to alter lighting, coloration, orientation, and sizing of data collected to create more test cases for the model. Uses VGG16 architecture to train a convolutional neural network to detect faces.

This project was used as a way for me to learn how to train convolutional neural networks and gain fundamentals of how image detection is performed and programmed.
